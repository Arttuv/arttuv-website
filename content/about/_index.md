I'm a software developer interested in human-computer interaction and everything related to usability. I have a master's degree on software development including basic studies in psychology and cognitive science.

Rather unconventionally most of my professional experience is from creating desktop applications. Lately they have been distributed and security critical professional applications.

That's also what I'm mostly interested in human-computer interaction - security critical and professional applications. This also means that my focus is somewhat different than on people developing public websites and mobile apps.
