				I've published some not-so-formal writings on this site. I include the references I've used in each writing, but the texts
				also contain my personal opinions which may or may not make sense. I work as a software engineer and have 5+ years of
				experience creating different kinds of software. I have a master's degree on software development including minors in
				psychology and cognitive science.
