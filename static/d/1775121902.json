I'd like to be more in control on what stories I see each day. At the same time I know the amount of items in RSS feeds can be intimidating, so I'm excited to try out new tools to combat information overload as well. I'm glad to see that RSS is not *dead*, even though I understand it probably should evolve as well. Feed aggregators must evolve as well, because the very basis of their being is dissolving.","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAHCAYAAAAIy204AAAACXBIWXMAACiaAAAomgEXOiGyAAAA4klEQVQoz5WR0YqDMBBF/f8PXGgfNi521SQ2NolmNEbvTixSCqVsLxwGEnJgcot1XVHXDaRU6HQH09+glEbOtm07n6RIKYGIsMSIGJd9TtP8JMzOg/v5G6G9WTjvMSbAEEDpuNqeeMjfU3jnUbY9smflt+Nyl2aW7aH898rWOtSNxMqrz/OMOE/8BQyvbQeCcYSrC1A2QFtC7wnWB/iRMDB5jmGCGwK/iSgcC4Uo97V7LuRqemgu53Q6czkKmguSUqKVGqKs8M1UjcbPr+LZQVQtvs4C4iKhjUWRW36VT9s98gcbZiLuZrt1tgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","aspectRatio":2.8636363636363638,"src":"/static/f284ce370d83512b09427e91dcd9315f/e1953/handrawn-google-trend-rss.png","srcSet":"/static/f284ce370d83512b09427e91dcd9315f/72176/handrawn-google-trend-rss.png 63w,\n/static/f284ce370d83512b09427e91dcd9315f/62d80/handrawn-google-trend-rss.png 125w,\n/static/f284ce370d83512b09427e91dcd9315f/e1953/handrawn-google-trend-rss.png 250w,\n/static/f284ce370d83512b09427e91dcd9315f/c6fa8/handrawn-google-trend-rss.png 375w,\n/static/f284ce370d83512b09427e91dcd9315f/46604/handrawn-google-trend-rss.png 500w,\n/static/f284ce370d83512b09427e91dcd9315f/30240/handrawn-google-trend-rss.png 2326w","sizes":"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/research/information-overload/rss-and-the-future-or-past-of-web/","readingTime":{"text":"6 min read"}}}},{"node":{"id":"89c801a9-bb5c-53e2-bb0f-95b78a72c85d","excerpt":"The expert group for the EU has published guidelines to promote Trustworthy AI.

The document specifies a list of requirements the systems should meet to be considered trustworthy. They also define a rough framework and an assessment list to offer guidance on practical implementation. The objective is to empower humans and offer them meaningful work instead of replacing them. Augmenting human abilities is an approach I'm happy to advocate for.","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/6c6a8d97fe1790d19f54a94203dec566/e1953/human-in-the-loop.png","srcSet":"/static/6c6a8d97fe1790d19f54a94203dec566/72176/human-in-the-loop.png 63w,\n/static/6c6a8d97fe1790d19f54a94203dec566/62d80/human-in-the-loop.png 125w,\n/static/6c6a8d97fe1790d19f54a94203dec566/e1953/human-in-the-loop.png 250w,\n/static/6c6a8d97fe1790d19f54a94203dec566/c6fa8/human-in-the-loop.png 375w,\n/static/6c6a8d97fe1790d19f54a94203dec566/46604/human-in-the-loop.png 500w,\n/static/6c6a8d97fe1790d19f54a94203dec566/bc59e/human-in-the-loop.png 512w","sizes":"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/automation-and-end-users/augment-complement-and-empower/","readingTime":{"text":"6 min read"}}}}]}}}
