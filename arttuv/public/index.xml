      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer interested in human-computer interaction and everything related to usability. I have a master&amp;rsquo;s degree on software development but I&amp;rsquo;ve also done basic studies in psychology and cognitive science.
Rather unconventionally most of my professional experience is from creating desktop applications. Usually they have been distributed and security critical.
That&amp;rsquo;s also what I&amp;rsquo;m mostly interested in human-computer interaction - security critical and professional applications. This also means that my focus is somewhat different than on people developing public websites and mobile apps.</description>
