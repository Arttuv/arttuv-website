                            <p class="drop-cap">Mostly I’ve been working as a programmer / software developer / software engineer. Usually this has meant designing and implementing software, from back end to front (and mainly in Java). I’ve been mostly interested in front end so I’ve also been designing and implementing user interfaces a lot. This has lead me to pursue specialization in interactive technology, and from 2018 I’ve been carrying out PhD research in human-computer interaction.</p>

                    <p><b>Software Engineer &amp; Usability Specialist 2017 – 2019</b></p>
                    <p>Designing and implementing simulator training system. Also responsible for the usability of the system. <p><b>Software Engineer 2014 – 2017</b></p> <p>Working as a software engineer creating mission-critical command and control systems.</p> <h3>Suonentieto Oy 2013 - 2014</h3> <p><b>Sofware Developer</b></p> <p>I worked with a desktop accounting software built with Delphi XE5 and Firebird database. In addition to Delphi I also needed SQL and user interface design skills to succeed in the work. The hardest part was fixing problems caused by a very old codebase. The best part of the work was close collaboration with the application testers – and the most rewarding was fixing usability problems. I learned that it’s not easy to change the user interface when there are thousands of existing users accustomed to the old one.</p> <h3>CGI Suomi Oy (and Logica) 2010 - 2013</h3> <h4>Programmer</h4> <p>I worked in a rather large SAP integration project doing specifications, implementation, and testing. I also had to fix bugs and make sure that the system was functional during the working hours. In addition to this, I worked a documentation project in which we had to document an old undocumented C application.</p> <p>The most interesting part of the work was doing data conversion scripts (Java, XSLT). It was also interesting to see what the update process a large scale application can be. Communication in a large project with multiple stakeholders is crucial.</p>
