      <description>Jakob Nielsen had a keynote at the UX Conference on Web UX 2016 vs 2004. They made a study on web UX on 2016 and reflected that to the results from similar study in 2004. The video is only 20 minutes and worth watching. Below you can find a short summary.

Abbreviated to one paragraph Most of the problems are in findability and search, so information architecture is a crucial thing and worth attending to.</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s interesting how old many of the usability (and software engineering) ideas are.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer interested in human-computer interaction and everything related to usability. I have a master&amp;rsquo;s degree on software development but I&amp;rsquo;ve also done basic studies in psychology and cognitive science.
Rather unconventionally most of my professional experience is from creating desktop applications. Usually they have been distributed and security critical.
That&amp;rsquo;s also what I&amp;rsquo;m mostly interested in human-computer interaction - security critical and professional applications. This also means that my focus is somewhat different than on people developing public websites and mobile apps.</description>
