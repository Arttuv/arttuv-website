      <description>Differences between references in Java can be explained by reachability. This is what Java API Specification says about reachability:
 Reachability from strongest to weakest:
An object is strongly reachable if it can be reached by some thread without traversing any reference objects. A newly-created object is strongly reachable by the thread that created it.
An object is softly reachable if it is not strongly reachable but can be reached by traversing a soft reference.</description>
