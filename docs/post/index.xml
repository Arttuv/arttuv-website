      <description>Different reference types in Java provide access to the object lifecycle, giving us tools for object reuse (object pools) and even a possibility to achieve a reliable object finalization. Differences between references can be explained by reachability. This is how Java API Specification defines reachability:
 Reachability from strongest to weakest:
 An object is strongly reachable if it can be reached by some thread without traversing any reference objects.</description>

Gould and Lewis introduce three principles that they argue are vital for creating usable applications, and then they go through common arguments against them and try to justify why these principles matter.
These three principles for designing for usability are (Gould &amp;amp; Lewis, 1985):</description>
