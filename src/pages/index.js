    <h1>Software, Human-Computer Interaction</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Arttu and I work with software. Currently I'm a software 
      consultant focusing on how to help organizations work in a more agile way.
    </p>
    <p>As a software developer Iâ€™ve been working mostly with Java 
      doing mission critical C2 and training applications.
    </p>
    <p>As a PhD researcher I study the effects of advanced automation 
      to operator performance and SA. Full autonomy is still far ahead and in some environments may never be a feasible option. Therefore augmenting human cognitive abilities with autonomous systems is the most interesting approach for me.</p>
