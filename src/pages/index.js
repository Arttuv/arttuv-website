            Hi, I'm Arttu and I work with software. Currently I'm a software 
            consultant focusing on how to help organizations work in a more agile way. Programming has
            been a long passion for me and I've been working as a developer, but I'm also
            interested in human-computer interaction and other aspects of software development. I have
            quite resently realized, that systemic thinking is something that resonates with me 
            and somewhat describes how I approach the world. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a <strong>software developer</strong> Iâ€™ve been working mostly with Java 
            doing mission critical C2 and training applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a <strong>PhD researcher</strong> I study the effects of advanced automation 
            to operator performance and SA. Full autonomy is still far ahead and in some environments may never be a feasible option. Therefore augmenting human cognitive abilities with autonomous systems is the most interesting approach for me.
