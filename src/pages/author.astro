            <h2>Who is Arttu?</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a software developer from Finland, currently living in Tampere. I have 15 years of experience from product companies to consulting.
            </p>
            <p>
                I never really thought of doing anything else but coding - it was just so fascinating to make computer do anything. I studied computer science, but since the interface of machines and humans is what really matters, I also studied cognitive science and psychology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m still learning how to combine all my interests in an optimal way to get the best outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I expect that learning path to take the rest of my career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans as collaborative digital tool makers is an interesting viewpoint.
