            <h1>Who is Arttu?</h1>
            <p>
                I love solving complex problems and working collaboratively with teams to achieve great outcomes. With close to 15 years of experience in the field, I'm a generalist who enjoys taking on a variety of challenges and constantly learning new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                My focus is on hands-on software development, and I pride myself on writing high-quality code that meets the needs of the business. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            However, I believe that the performance of a team is more critical than any individual's skills, and that's why I am also passionate about studying and improving teamwork and shared leadership. I'm always seeking ways to help teams work more effectively together without relying on traditional command and control structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that diverse teams collaborating and working together with a shared purpose are key to achieving the best outcomes. It's not something that happens automatically - it needs to be fostered and nurtured.
            </p>
            <p>
                I find meaning in doing work that matters and being committed to achieving positive outcomes. I love an environment in whch teams have a high degree of autonomy and they can self-organise to meet the challenge at hand. Titles don't define what you can (or are allowed) to do - what matters is making good things happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m still learning how to combine all my interests in an optimal way to get the best outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I expect that learning path to take the rest of my career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans as collaborative digital tool makers is an interesting viewpoint.

                I started programming somewhere around 1999. My first language was QBasic and later switched to Turbo Pascal, which I really liked.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the time I probably enjoyed programming the most: I had no idea what I was doing, and I was learning this alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a lot of time at library trying to find relevant books or online resources for programming. I built ASCII games using IF-ELSE technology, because I knew of nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spark of programming stayed and I never really thought of doing anything else for a living.
